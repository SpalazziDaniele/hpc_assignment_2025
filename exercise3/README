Description:
This project allow to run experiments for simultaion of heat propagation for two different cofigurations (A and B) that change for the grid configuration and the propagation law.

Requirements:
gcc compiler
SLURM job scheduler

Project structure:
logs/
ex3_caseA.c
caseA_3.slurm
ex3_caseB.c
caseB_3.slurm


Usage:

A. Single node experiment
Run: sbatch caseA_3.slurm
Output: grid_A_dim.csv, execution_times_A_dim.csv

B. Single node experiment
Run: sbatch caseB_3.slurm
Output: grid_B_dim.csv, execution_times_B_dim.csv
